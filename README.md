# Cybersecurity Threats Analytics Dashboard 📊🔐

An interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing global cybersecurity attacks across industries (2015–2024).

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project explores how hackers target companies and what vulnerabilities they exploit. Using a dataset from Kaggle, I've built a Power BI dashboard that allows users to:

- Filter attacks by industry.
- View total number of attacks and financial losses.
- Analyze trends in types of attacks and vulnerabilities.
